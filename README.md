# Emotion-Classification-using-BERT
This repository contains the code and report for a Natural Language Processing (NLP) coursework project, completed as part of the MSci Data Science course at City, University of London (2023/2024). The project explores different baseline models to classify emotions in tweets using the Twitter dataset.

The primary model used in this project is BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), specifically the uncased version. The model was fine-tuned to classify emotions, and an error analysis was conducted to investigate the patterns of misclassification in the data.
